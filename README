* added viewdate.py to test for dates
- changed from UTC to localtime for dates created
* curating the source
- pil_resize has a problem because it shoves thru all files
  not just jpgs which I want to resize. 
- introduce idea of curating the source file so we control
  what is processed by what is in the source directory.
- that is until we write code to handle the edge cases such
  as mp4s, gifs etc.
