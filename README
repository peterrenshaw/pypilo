2019OCT26
* New bug listed (is it? but I should solve)
- fails: problem with input
- doesn't work with .PNG

* fails on /usr/bin/python
- works on /usr/bin env python3

* failed first use today
- pil_tools failed on running using py3
- solution?

  sudo port selfupdate
  sudo port upgrade updated

- re-install Pillow
  <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>

  $ sudo pip install Pillow
  $ python3 process.py -h 

  Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input=INPUT
                        input source directory
  -o OUTPUT, --output=OUTPUT
                        output source directory
  -j, --jpg             process only jpg files

2019OCT12
* had to reset the IP for gitolite access
- <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2432764/how-to-change-the-uri-url-for-a-remote-git-repository>

  git remote set-url origin git@ip.address:pypilo

* wrapper for processing for image and videos
- new function processing.process()

  process(afiles, dest_fp)

  afiles:  list of filepathsnames 
  dest_fp: destination filepath

2019SEP21
* added viewdate.py to test for dates
- changed from UTC to localtime for dates created
* curating the source
- pil_resize has a problem because it shoves thru all files
  not just jpgs which I want to resize. 
- introduce idea of curating the source file so we control
  what is processed by what is in the source directory.
- that is until we write code to handle the edge cases such
  as mp4s, gifs etc.

2019SEP18
* bug on pil_tools.py
- function calc_image_size with barfed args
- fixed
    
2019SEP17
* lots of internal changes
- moved PIL code into pil_tools.py
- other tools into tools.py
- added BUGS, TODO

* check TODO
* copying to remote repro
* documentation
* fixed the bugs in BUGS
* working on this for a while
